# To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and the following processes were performed:
Exploratory Data Analysis
- During the exploratory data analysis, a boxplot and histogram was visualized for each numeric datatype column. 
- Also, a barplot was visualized for each categorical column. 
- This gave a good baseline for all of the numeric and categorical columns for univariate EDA.
